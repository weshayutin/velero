### Highlights

#### Data Mover Adds Support for Block Mode Volumes
For PersistentVolumes with volumeMode set as Block, the volumes are mounted as raw block devices in pods, in 1.12.1, Velero CSI snapshot data movement supports to backup and restore this kind of volumes under linux based Kubernetes clusters.

#### New Parameter in Installation to Enable Data Mover
The `velero install` sub-command now includes a new parameter,`--default-snapshot-move-data`, which configures Velero server to move data by default for all snapshots supporting data movement. This feature is useful for users who will always want to use VBDM for backups instead of plain CSI , as they no longer need to specify the `--snapshot-move-data` flag for each individual backup. 

#### Velero Base Image change
The base image previously used by Velero was `distroless`,  which contains several CVEs cannot be addressed quickly. As a result, Velero will now use `paketobuildpacks` image starting from this new version.

### Limitations/Known issues
* The data mover's support for block mode volumes is currently only applicable to Linux environments.

### Highlights

#### CSI Snapshot Data Movement
CSI Snapshot Data Movement refers to back up CSI snapshot data from the volatile and limited production environment into durable, heterogeneous, and scalable backup storage in a consistent manner; and restore the data to volumes in the original or alternative environment.

CSI Snapshot Data Movement is useful in below scenarios:

* For on-premises users, the storage usually doesn't support durable snapshots, so it is impossible/less efficient/cost ineffective to keep volume snapshots by the storage This feature helps to move the snapshot data to a storage with lower cost and larger scale for long time preservation.
* For public cloud users, this feature helps users to fulfill the multiple cloud strategy. It allows users to back up volume snapshots from one cloud provider and preserve or restore the data to another cloud provider. Then users will be free to flow their business data across cloud providers based on Velero backup and restore

CSI Snapshot Data Movement is built according to the Volume Snapshot Data Movement design ([Volume Snapshot Data Movement design](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/blob/main/design/volume-snapshot-data-movement/volume-snapshot-data-movement.md)). Additionally, guidance on how to use the feature can be found in the Volume Snapshot Data Movement doc([Volume Snapshot Data Movement doc](https://velero.io/docs/v1.12/csi-snapshot-data-movement)).

#### Resource Modifiers
In many use cases, customers often need to substitute specific values in Kubernetes resources during the restoration process like changing the namespace, changing the storage class, etc. 

To address this need, Resource Modifiers (also known as JSON Substitutions) offer a generic solution in the restore workflow. It allows the user to define filters for specific resources and then specify a JSON patch (operator, path, value) to apply to the resource. This feature simplifies the process of making substitutions without requiring the implementation of a new RestoreItemAction plugin. More design details can be found in Resource Modifiers design ([Resource Modifiers design](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/blob/main/design/Implemented/json-substitution-action-design.md)). For instructions on how to use the feature, please refer to Resource Modifiers doc([Resource Modifiers doc](https://velero.io/docs/v1.12/restore-resource-modifiers)). 

#### Multiple VolumeSnapshotClasses
Prior to version 1.12, the Velero CSI plugin would choose the VolumeSnapshotClass in the cluster based on matching driver names and the presence of the "velero.io/csi-volumesnapshot-class" label. However,  this approach proved inadequate for many user scenarios.

With the introduction of version 1.12, Velero now offers support for multiple VolumeSnapshotClasses in the CSI Plugin, enabling users to select a specific class for a particular backup. More design details can be found in Multiple VolumeSnapshotClasses design ([Multiple VolumeSnapshotClasses design](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/blob/main/design/Implemented/multiple-csi-volumesnapshotclass-support.md)). For instructions on how to use the feature, please refer to Multiple VolumeSnapshotClasses doc ([Multiple VolumeSnapshotClasses doc](https://velero.io/docs/v1.12/csi/#implementation-choices)). 

#### Restore Finalizer
Before v1.12, the restore controller would only delete restore resources but wouldnâ€™t delete restore data from the backup storage location when the command `velero restore delete` was executed. The only chance Velero deletes restores data from the backup storage location is when the associated backup is deleted.

In this version, Velero introduces a finalizer that ensures the cleanup of all associated data for restores when running the command `velero restore delete`.

#### Runtime and dependencies
To fix CVEs and keep pace with Golang, Velero made changes as follows:
* Bump Golang runtime to v1.20.7.
* Bump several dependent libraries to new versions.
* Bump Kopia to v0.13.


### Breaking changes
* Prior to v1.12, the parameter `uploader-type` for Velero installation had a default value of "restic". However, starting from this version, the default value has been changed to "kopia". This means that Velero will now use Kopia as the default path for file system backup.
* The ways of setting CSI snapshot time have changed in v1.12. First, the sync waiting time for creating a snapshot handle in the CSI plugin is changed from the fixed 10 minutes into backup.Spec.CSISnapshotTimeout. The second, the async waiting time for VolumeSnapshot and VolumeSnapshotContent's status turning into `ReadyToUse` in operation uses the operation's timeout. The default value is 4 hours.
* As from [Velero helm chart v4.0.0](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/helm-charts/releases/tag/velero-4.0.0), it supports multiple BSL and VSL, and the BSL and VSL have changed from the map into a slice, and[ this breaking change](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/helm-charts/pull/413) is not backward compatible. So it would be best to change the BSL and VSL configuration into slices before the Upgrade.
* Prior to v1.12, deleting the Velero namespace would easily remove all the resources within it. However, with the introduction of finalizers attached to the Velero CR including `restore`, `dataupload`, and `datadownload` in this version, directly deleting Velero namespace may get stuck indefinitely because the pods responsible for handling the finalizers might be deleted before the resources attached to the finalizers. To avoid this issue, please use the command `velero uninstall` to delete all the Velero resources or ensure that you handle the finalizer appropriately before deleting the Velero namespace.


### Limitations/Known issues
* The Azure plugin supports Azure AD Workload identity way, but it only works for Velero native snapshots. It cannot support filesystem backup and snapshot data mover scenarios. 
* File System backup under Kopia path and CSI Snapshot Data Movement backup fail to back up files that are large the 2GiB due to issue https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/issues/6668.
